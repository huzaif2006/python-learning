for x in range(50):
    pass   #pass is the null statemrnt in python, its instruct to do nothing  without pass the program will throw an error because you did not writ any code in for loop


for i in range(100):  # when wejust write one num in range function it will automatically consider the 1st value as zero and last you will write
    if(i == 50):
        break    # if the condition will match exit the loop right now
    print(i)



for j in range(50):
    if(j == 35):
        continue    #if the condition will true this keyword will skip the current iteration and move on next one
    print(j)
